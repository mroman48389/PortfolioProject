/* 
    Hide text that we may add to elements for screen-readers (sr) so as not to break accessibility. 
    Ex: "Back" on a back arrow button that we don't explicitly want to see the word "Back" on:

        <a href="/" class="back">
            <span class="sr-only">back</span>
        </a>
   
    position: Absolute removes elements with these classes from the document flow.
    width, height: 1 minimizes the size. Can't be zero or screen reader may ignore it or not focus on it. Minimal size
        makes for a minimal footprint.
    padding: Remove spacing.
    overflow: Hidden hides any content overflow.
    margin: Push it offscreen.
    clip: Hides the element.
    white-space: Nowrap prevents line breaks.
    border: 0 removes visual borders.
